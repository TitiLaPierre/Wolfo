# Contribute to Woflo
üåê Would you like to read this document in French? Please visit [this link](https://github.com/Romitou/Wolfo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_FR.md).

Welcome! We are very happy for your interest in this project.
Please know that we are very sympathetic and we look forward to receiving your contribution.
 
Even if you are only new to Skript, you can contribute as an advanced developer.
Indeed, some simple contributions can be very useful if you do not master Skript.

## üí° Suggesting your ideas and suggestions for improvement
Your feedback remains at the heart of our concerns. In order for our project to please as many people as possible, your feedback is the best way to improve us. We love to hear from you.

## üåê Translating and improving the accuracy of the configuration texts
We don't have a lot of time to check the spelling and conjugation of our sentences. If you are a French language pro, your help will obviously be welcome.

We hope that this project can be used by as many people as possible. To do so, we are publishing this script on different platforms in different countries.

## üêõ Perform different tests on your server (in order to find bugs)
This contribution is one of the most important: correcting malfunctions. If you manage to find something that doesn't work as it should, don't hesitate to open a bug report.

## üë• Contribute to the code
You want to add features, fix bugs or simply modify the code? You can go through GitHub to propose your modifications. Here is a short tutorial to help you.

### 1. create a copy of the code (= fork)
For that, nothing could be simpler! Press the `Fork` button located in the upper right hand corner next to the `Star` button. This action will clone the code to your account, any changes you make will have no influence on the main code.

### 2. Edit Code
We recommend that you use an editor like Visual Studio Code that integrates directly with the Git terminal to make your changes in a few clicks. You can also use GitHub Desktop if you don't have an editor that includes Git. Once a file has been edited, you need to "commit" it by providing a short name for the subject of the changes (e.g., `Fix scoreboard players`). Once all your `commits` are saved, you'll need to push your changes (= send your changes).

### 3. Submit your changes
You have modified all your files and you wish to submit your changes? Nothing could be easier: click on the `Pull requests` tab and then on `New pull request`. Change the `base repository` to `Romitou/Wolfo` and `base` to `dev`. Check that the `head repository` matches yours and `compare` matches `dev`. Don't you see these terms? Click `compare across forks`. Then click `Create pull request`, add a title and description to your changes and submit. Great!

### 4. Code Review
We may have noticed some things to change about your code. **2 people minimum** will have to approve your changes. If something needs to be changed, don't panic! It doesn't matter, you will have to modify your code according to the reviews by following the same tutorial (`2. Editing the code`). Once all good, your changes will be published, congratulations!

**Note: if you have any question, don't hesitate to come and see us on note [Discord](https://discord.gg/37nvkpk).**
